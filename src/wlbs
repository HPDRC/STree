                                          specified cluster
  reload    [<cluster> | ALL]           - reloads the driver's parameters from
                                          the registry for the specified
                                          cluster (local only). Same as ALL if
                                          parameter is not specified.
  display   [<cluster> | ALL]           - displays configuration parameters,
                                          current status, and last several

                                          for the current members of the
                                          specified cluster. If not specified a
                                          local query is performed for all
                                          instances.
  suspend   [<cluster_spec>]            - suspends cluster operations (start,

                                          specified, applies to all instances
                                          on local host.

  stop      [<cluster_spec>]            - stops cluster operations on the
                                          specified hosts. Applies to local

  drainstop [<cluster_spec>]            - disables all new traffic handling on
                                          the specified hosts and stops cluster
                                          operations. Applies to local host if
                                          cluster is not specified.
  enable    <port_spec> <cluster_spec>  - enables traffic handling on the
                                          specified cluster for the rule whose

            [<cluster_spec>]              port rule. If the rule is handling
                                          traffic, packet handling statistics
                                          are also returned.
