== How to load new navteq datasets into stree

1. Login to: 131.94.131.211:4000(Administrator/HPDRC4002)

2. Goto D:\Stree\streets, create a new cmd script (modify the path accordingly):
@echo off

FOR /D %%G in ("\\atlantic\atlantic-01\staged-data\navteq\2017-01\*") DO (
Echo copying %%G
xcopy %%G\Streets.* navteq_new\%%G\
)

3. Check: the server can access \\atlantic\atlantic-01\ using user ad\gallery. 
Check: there is enough disk space for the copying
Execute the script
Then delete all folders with characters (keep only folders with two numbers)

4. Delete (backup) D:\Stree\streets\AllStates.*
Then run D:\Stree\streeweb.exe

5. streeweb.exe will 
    A. Generate Streets.NAV files under all D:\Stree\streets\navstreets\* folders
    B. Merge all NAV files into D:\Stree\streets\AllStates.NAV
    C. Merge all Tiger data into AllStates.MAP (can use old MAP file directly)
    D. Merge AllStates.NAV with AllStates.MAP and generate AllStates.MER
    E. Generate AllStates.idx

    131.94.131.211 (old stree1) is really slow and could throw exception at any time.
    If it does, do the following:
        Copy D:\Stree\streets\navstreets\*\Streets.NAV to stree3.cs.fiu.edu(administrator/HPDRC5002) same folder, and run streeweb from stree3
    This is because the running environment on other machines are broken and only old stree1 can generate Streets.NAV properly. So step A must be done on old stree1
    
6. After AllStates.NAV AllStates.MAP AllStates.MER AllStates.idx are all ready, copy them to stree4 and restart 80 port
